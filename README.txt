Note: 
According to Coursera's honor code, you can get banned for copying other people's code. Refer to this if and only if you are facing difficulties for a long time and are unable to find solutions on the discussion forums and other places like Stack overflow or the Octave/Matlab documentation. 
Do not copy paste code, that is in violation of the honor code. You make draw inspiration from my code and modify yours accordingly. 
Thanks, be honest with yourself.
